FILES
- bags:
    - bag1.bag
    - bag2.bag
    - bag3.bag

- cfg:
    - parameters.cfg -> file for the dynamic reconfigure

- launch:
    - scout_launch.launch -> launch file, launches the velpubsub, odompubsub and residual nodes.
                             It is also possible to change the inital position of the robot.

    - scout_launch_rviz.launch -> launch file, just like the other one but it also plays the bag and 
                                  runs rviz with the right configuration. 

- msg:
    - OdomInt.msg -> contains the custom message to publish odometry and integration method
    
    - er_array.msg -> custom message to publish the residuals between the ground truth and the 
                      estimated odometry

- srv:
    - resetOdom.srv -> empty, it does not need any input from the user since it simply resets the pose

    - seOdom.srv -> defines the types of the requested input from the user to set the pose to x, y, theta

- src: 
    - velpubsub.cpp  -> the node that subscribes to the rpm topics and publishes a 
                        twist message containing all of the robot's speeds
                       
    - odompubsub.cpp -> the node that subscribes to the topic advertised by velpubsub
                        and publishes the complete odometry and the custom message

    - residuals.cpp -> the node publishes the residuals between /scout_odom and our computed odometry /our_odom
                        and also the residuals between /gt_pose (in odom reference frame) and /our_odom

- scout_rviz.rviz -> rviz configuration to visualize the computed odometry vs the ground truth


ROS PARAMETERS
- x_init:     initial x position in the odom frame
- y_init:     initial y position in the odom frame
- theta_init: initial yaw angle wrt the odom frame
- CHI :       ratio between apparent and real base_line
- Inv_RATIO:  1/ratio of the gearbox

TF TREE:
- odom
    - base_link
    - world (static transform)



CUSTOM MESSAGES
- OdomInt.msg:
    - nav_msgs/Odometry odo
    - std_msgs/String   int_method

- er_array.msg:
    - std_msgs/Float64 dx
    - std_msgs/Float64 dy
    - std_msgs/Float64 dtheta
    - std_msgs/Float64 cumulateError
      

HOW TO RUN EVERYTHING
I - catkin_make in the catkin workspace root
II- source catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
1 - roslaunch project1 scout_launch.launch
2 - rosbag play -l bag1.bag 
    NB: for this second step you must cd to the folder where the bag files are (catkin_ws/src/bags)
It is now possible to echo the data from the different topics 

If you want to visualize the movement on rviz:
1 - Launch as before
2 - Open rviz with the scout_rviz.rviz configuration
3 - Play the bag 

You can also simply launch the scout_launch_rviz.launch file, it will take care of everything.

For the dynamic reconfigure:
 while the nodes are running, type in the bash:
 rosrun dynamic_reconfigure dynparam set /odompubsub intmethod value
 "Value" can be either 0 for euler integration or 1 for runge - kutta

Reset service: rosservice call /reset_odom
Set service:   rosservice call /set_odom x y theta 
    NB: theta must be in [deg]


APPENDIX - APPARENT BASELINE AND TRANSMISSION RATIO
Both parameters have been estimated following a heuristic function comparing the estimated velocities values 
with the ground truth ones. For the transmission ratio we've used the values of the longitudinal velocity vx, 
whereas for the apparent baseline we've used the angular velocity wz.
The best values we've found are the following:
- Transmission ratio: 1:38.7
- Apparent baseline:  1.75 * B

To have a quantitative assessment of how we were improving when changing the parameters, we used plotJuggler
the residuals node moentioned above: the cumulateError is a filtered error, which means that it is the
average of the last 100 quadratic errors. Each quadratic error is the square root of the sum of the square
of deltaX, deltaY, deltaTheta (each multiplied by a particular quadratic weight).
In IMG1.png we show the cumulateError (on the left), deltaY over deltaX error on the top right, and deltaTheta
(in rad) over time on the bottom right.

We also considered /gt_pose and its errors. METTERE QUI UN COMMENTO SE CI RIUSCIAMO
In IMG2.png we show the same graphs for the errors with respect to /gt_pose.

APPENDIX - "odom" TO "world" ROTOTRANSLATION
To compute this rototranslation we copied 2 messages with rostopic echo from /scout_odom and /gt_pose
/gt_pose is not accurate in the first seconds, so we waited for some seconds (about 10-11s) and as
soon as we saw a coherent /gt_pose we copied its pose and the corresponding /scout_odom pose.
We assume that at the beginning /scout_odom is correct, so we can use its pose as reference to
find the rototranslation from odom (frame_id of /scout_odom) and world (frame id of /gt_pose)
This has been computed in MATLAB (in the script rototranslation.m)
